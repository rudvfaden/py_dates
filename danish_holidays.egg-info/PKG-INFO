# Danish Banking Holidays

A Python package for calculating Danish banking holidays and business days.

## Installation

```bash
pip install danish_holidays
```

## Usage

### New Interface (Recommended)

```python
from danish_banking_holidays.calendar import DanishBankingCalendar
from datetime import date

# Create a calendar instance
calendar = DanishBankingCalendar()

# Get all holidays for a year
holidays = calendar.get_holidays(2023)
for day, name in holidays.items():
    print(f"{name}: {day}")

# Check if a date is a holiday or weekend
is_holiday = calendar.is_holiday(date(2023, 12, 25))  # True for Christmas

# Get next business day
next_working_day = calendar.next_business_day(date(2023, 12, 24))  # Dec 27th (after Christmas)

# Get previous business day
prev_working_day = calendar.previous_business_day(date(2023, 12, 26))  # Dec 22nd

# Add business days to a date
future_date = calendar.add_business_days(date(2023, 1, 1), 5)  # Skips weekends and holidays
```

## Notes

The legacy function module `danish_banking_holidays.bankdag` has been removed. If you
previously used that API, update your imports to use `DanishBankingCalendar` as shown
in the examples above.
